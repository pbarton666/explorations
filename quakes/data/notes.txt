GIS files for OK_ClassII have these extensions:
cpg (contains one line "UTF-8")
dbf: unreadable (dBASE file of attributes based on geometry column of main)
prj: (apparently metada like timezone and units of measure)
sbn: unreadable
sbx: unreadable
shx: unreadable (offset of records fr: beginning of file)
shp: unreadable (each record = shape)

Geopandas allows modeling of points, lines, and polygons from Shapely.  Shapely depends on rtree and spatialindex.

import pandas as pd  # provides interface for interacting with tabular data
import geopandas as gpd  #  pandas + shapely for geospatial operations
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon, MultiPolygon  # text -> shapes 
from shapely import wkt  # well known text ('experanto') 
import rtree  # supports geospatial join

Shapefiles are a cluster of files (cpg, dbf, prj, shp, shx).  Limitations: headers max len = 10 char; text max len 254 char; max fields is 255.
