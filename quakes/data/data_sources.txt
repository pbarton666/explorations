Greetings,

Thanks for the opportunity to apply for your Content Technology Developer position.

I may be the ideal candidate because I bring a deep fusion of:

- hands-on experience working as a developer and consumer of technical products;
- teaching a variety of complex technical topics to adults of various skill levels;  and 
- developing curriculum for adult professionals.

These are, I believe, all essential elements of strong performance in this role and I can (IMHO) deliver a solid balance among them.

I would look forward to further discussions with your team.
